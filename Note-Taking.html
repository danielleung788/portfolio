        <h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
        <ul style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
          <li>This design challenge was very open ended and really challenged us to put emphasis on our thought process
            and show how we navigated through an open ended problem. In this challenge, I designed and created a
            wireframe and visual mockup of a note-taking app for taking notes in class. The assumptions I made before
            starting the designing of this app are is that the user is taking notes on a laptop/tablet with a tablet pen
            and that the laptop/tablet is a touch screen device that is connected to the internet.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Process</strong></h3>
        <ul style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
          <li> The process I followed was to create an analogy to base the app design off
            of. I thought about how I would want to navigate through this app from beginning to
            end as if I was a user and what I would want to see throughout the process. I started
            by creating the opening screen that would be seen upon launching the application.
            Through the starting process, I thought about how this would be similar to
            looking through a backpack for a notebook, but instead, through an app interface.
            Similar to looking through a backpack, I would want all the notebooks I have used
            recently to be easily seen and accessible. Unlike a backpack, an app for note-taking
            has the ability to be organized every time it is opened. Therefore, this screen needs
            to be organized, easy to navigate, simple, and intuitive.
          </li>
          <li><img src="assets/img/portfolio/note-1.png"
              style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; width: 50%; height: 50%; display: block; margin-top: 10px;">
          </li>
          <li> On this screen, I first drew out the notebooks in an easy to navigate grid
            format with the names of each notebook labeled underneath. That way the user
            would be able to easily access the notebook they needed to use for a particular class
            without digging through a messy interface.
            I then walked through the process, continuing with the backpack analogy; I
            have dug through my backpack and found the notebook for this class, now
            what? (I have selected the notebook on the app, now what?) Once I have the
            correct notebook in my hand, I would flip to the newest page and start taking my
            notes. That makes sense with the backpack analogy, but, there is no ‘flipping to the
            newest page’ for an app, and even if there was, I would not want to do that every
            single time I pulled my notebook out.
            Following that, a thought crossed my mind: I am taking notes so I have
            something to study off of, how would I access the notes I have taken
            previously? And this thought is where the second page was created as seen in
            Figure 2.
